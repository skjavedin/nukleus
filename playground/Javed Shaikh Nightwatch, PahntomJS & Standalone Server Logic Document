I tried to get it as quickly as possible within span of 1 day. I learnt about how can I use the nightwatch.js along with the PhantomJS and standalone server.

For your reference here is the logic which I used.

I check the Nightwatch.json file from the "bin" folder of the Nightwatch and made the following changes to incorporate PhantomJS.
I placed the PhantomJS file in the same folder as my nightwatchJS.

"phantomjs" : {
      "desiredCapabilities" : {
        "browserName" : "phantomjs",
        "javascriptEnabled" : true,
        "acceptSslCerts" : true,
        "phantomjs.binary.path" : "./phantomjs.exe"
        

Then I added the server for the execution. I made start_process as true to make sure that the server execute at each run 
and the path provided is of the same folder where the nightwacth exist.

"selenium" : {
    "start_process" : true,
    "server_path" : "./Server/selenium standalone server.jar",
    "log_path" : "",
    "host" : "127.0.0.1",
    "port" : 4444,
    "cli_args" : {
      "webdriver.chrome.driver" : "",
      "webdriver.ie.driver" : "",
      "webdriver.firefox.profile" : ""
      
   Additonally I added the website for which the E2E needs to be taken place.
   
   "test_settings" : {
    "default" : {
      "launch_url" : "https://www.google.com/",
      "selenium_host" : "127.0.0.1",
      "selenium_port" : 4444,
      "silent" : true,
      "disable_colors": false,
      "screenshots" : {
        "enabled" : false,
        "path" : ""
        
Combining these 3 things I have executed it using the command prompt.

C:\Project>node nightwatch.js -e phantomjs

It executed and shown the success message.
